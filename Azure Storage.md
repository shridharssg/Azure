Azure Storage is Microsoft’s cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. 
Azure Storage provides highly available, scalable, secure, managed, accessible storage solution at a fraction of the cost
Azure Storage provides multiple options for storing various types of data in the cloud. When you think about cloud, it is all about storing data in a remote location and accessing it from anywhere in the world.


Azure storage is :

Durable and highly available:
Redundancy ensures that your data is safe in the event of hardware failures. You can also opt to replicate data across datacenters or geographical regions for additional protection from local natural disaster or any. Data replicated in this way remains highly available in the event of an unexpected outage.

Secure: All data written to Azure Storage is encrypted by the service.

Scalability  :  Data is automatically scaled out and load-balanced to meet peak demands.

Managed: Microsoft Azure handles hardware maintenance, updates, and critical issues for you.

Accessible: Data in Azure Storage is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Microsoft provides SDKs for Azure Storage in a variety of languages — .NET, Java, Node.js, Python and others — as well as a mature REST API. Azure Storage supports scripting in Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. And the Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer offer easy visual solutions for working with your data.
