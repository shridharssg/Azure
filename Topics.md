Azure Portal

The Azure Portal it’s a Web interface from which you can create and manage services and resources.
 You can access the Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com/ and sign in with your Azure account. 
If you don’t have an Azure account yet, you can create one for free.

Azure Portal provides a range of features such as dashboards to view and monitor resources as well as a billing dashboard, 
a resource explorer to browse and manage your resources, a marketplace with Azure services and third-party applications, 
provides the Azure Cloud Shell, which is a browser-based shell (a command-line interface that you can access and use directly from a web browser), 
which allows you to run scripts and commands to manage Azure resources, and other features.
